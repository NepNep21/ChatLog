# ChatLog
A simple minecraft fabric 1.16.x mod for logging chat to a separate file and optionally a discord webhook

Things to note:

The mod requires cloth-config  
The mod DOES NOT require fabric api  
I couldn't figure out a way to include non mod dependencies in a not jank way, so in mod menu a few things that aren't mods, might appear  
The mod logs to logs/chat-log-insertDateHere.log  
Webhook settings are configured in config/chatlog.json
